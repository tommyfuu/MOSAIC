# integrating multiple microbiome datasets for pooled analyses
Code and partial data repository for the manuscript entitled __Comprehensive Analytical Approaches for Integrating Multiple Microbiome Studies__ by _Fu et al._.

This github repository stores the code for the data integration pipeline as described in the manuscript, which includes data generation as well as the execution and evaluations of microbiome cross-study data integration methods. The goal of this repository are to enable readers to reproduce the analyses done in the paper as well as leveraging their own data along with the provided code to decide which data integration method they wish to use for their own analyses. Our pipeline consists of three steps:
- Data generation/collection
- Running data integration (batch correction) methods on datasets to corrected data
- Evaluation of the methods

For instructions on how to run this pipeline, please check out the [**wiki**](https://github.com/tommyfuu/mic_data_integration/wiki) section at the top middle of this github repository!

This project started as a class project in Dr. Wesley Tansey's class Foundation of Data Science at Memorial Sloan Kettering and Weill Cornell, and would not have been possible without the generous support of Dr. Wodan Ling, Jiuyao Lu, Dr. Quaid Morris, and Dr. Wesley Tansey. The funding support for my PhD comes from the Tri-institutional Program of Computational Biology and Medicine.
